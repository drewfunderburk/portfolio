Based on the new feature film, MALUM, Flock of the Low God VR immerses gamers in the horrifying world of the "The Flock", 
and pits them against an onslaught of cult members and creatures as they attempt to breach the confines of Lanford Police Department. 
Put on the badge, grab a weapon, and fight off The Flock and the entities they've conjured before it's too late. Play alone, 
or gather your friends, and prepare for a combat-based VR survival horror experience like no other.

I was responsible for AI design and programming, level event flow, player interaction, sound and audio programming, tools programming, 
and the game’s tutorial. The VR AI for Flock of the Low God involved a detailed perception system and a complex behavior tree to 
allow members of The Flock to track the player in an organic and terrifying way without feeling robotic or overpowered. 
Audio is always important in games, but especially so in horror titles. The sound in Flock of the Low God is designed and implemented 
to maximize suspense and promote the player’s tension at key points throughout the experience.

## Proximo One
Proximo One is an in-the-works rogue-lite sci-fi first-person shooter in which players must handle their escape from space prison. 
Stealing a rickety ship with limited supplies to use as a home base, players will chart their own course as they flee the 
long arm of the law and do their best to keep the ship and each other in one piece.

This project is currently in its early stages, and is being co-developed with
<a href="https://sethdaigle.artstation.com/"><img src="/assets/img/Icons/artstation.png" alt="ArtStation Icon" width="15" align="bottom"/> Seth Daigle</a>.
It implements ledge-grabbing and sliding for the player to facilitate fast, agile movement across the environment, 
a weapon’s system to enable players to choose their preferred build, and simple AI for level testing and feel. 
I am currently developing my skills in the area of networking and multiplayer, and am rebuilding our existing player to 
excel in a multiplayer environment with replicated functionality and client prediction for smooth sync across players.

## UNO - Materials Lab
A collaboration with the University of New Orleans, Materials Lab allows the player to take on the role of a medieval blacksmith in VR, 
learning the old methods of smelting ore and smithing bronze, iron, and even steel.

I was a solo programmer on this project, and responsible for every facet of it’s development. Materials Lab required a thorough 
understanding of the subject material, as well as the implementation of a complex VR player interaction system to simulate realistic 
movements and reactions within the experience.

## Louisiana Wind Hub
Taking place in the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana Wind Hub is an educational VR demonstration on the State of Louisiana's prime positioning 
for wind power both now and in the future. Louisiana Wind Hub has been shown everywhere from schools to congress.

I was a solo programmer on this project, and worked with the client to steer the experience every step of the way. 
Louisiana Wind Hub required great attention to the safety and comfort of the demonstration, as its target audience is frequently having 
their first experience with VR. I took great care to ensure that the client’s requests were implemented in a comfortable and engaging 
way throughout the experience.

## Density Lab
A collaboration with the University of New Orleans, Density Lab is a VR chemistry lab teaching the concept and applications of density.

I was a solo programmer on this project, and led the development process to completion. Density Lab is used to replace lab time for 
chemistry students, and as such involved a fully functioning chemistry lab. I implemented a crafting system to allow students to mix 
and match chemicals in a safe VR environment, enabling them to experiment with solutions that might otherwise be hazardous in the real world.
